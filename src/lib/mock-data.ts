// DEBUGGING NOTES:
// - If search page shows no results, check that typeFilter logic in search/page.tsx matches these type values
// - If buttons don't appear, verify phone/website properties exist (some entries may not have both)
// - If filtering doesn't work, ensure the Chip component onClick handlers update typeFilter state correctly
// - To add more places: follow the same structure, use unique IDs, and maintain the vet/shelter type balance
// - Mock fetch helpers simulate real API delays for better UX testing
